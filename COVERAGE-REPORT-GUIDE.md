# Test Coverage Report Generation Guide

## ðŸ“Š How to Generate Coverage Reports

### Server Coverage
Run from the **root directory**:
```bash
cd server && pnpm test -- --coverage
```

**Generated files:**
- HTML Report: `server/coverage/index.html`
- LCOV Report: `server/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- Coverage Data: `server/coverage/coverage-final.json`

### Client Coverage  
Run from the **root directory**:
```bash
cd client && pnpm test -- --coverage
```

**Generated files:**
- HTML Report: `client/coverage/index.html`
- LCOV Report: `client/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- Coverage Data: `client/coverage/coverage-final.json`

## ðŸ“¸ Taking Screenshots for Submission

### 1. Server Coverage Screenshot
1. Run: `cd server && pnpm test -- --coverage`
2. Open: `server/coverage/index.html` in browser
3. Take full-page screenshot
4. Save as: `screenshots/coverage-reports/server-coverage.png`

### 2. Client Coverage Screenshot
1. Run: `cd client && pnpm test -- --coverage`
2. Open: `client/coverage/index.html` in browser  
3. Take full-page screenshot
